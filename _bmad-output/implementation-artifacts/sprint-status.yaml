# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
# - Dependencies: Epic 5 depends on Epic 1 (search API), Epic 6 depends on Epic 5 (proposals), Epic 8 last (audits all)
