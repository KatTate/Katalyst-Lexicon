# Design Document

## Katalyst Lexicon as a Website and Internal Software Product

## 1. Summary

Katalyst needs a canonical, organization-wide vocabulary that reduces ambiguity, accelerates decision-making, and enforces consistent language across strategy, planning, delivery, and culture.

This document defines the product requirements and implementation plan for **Katalyst Lexicon**, delivered as:

* **V1:** an internal web app (responsive) with editorial workflows and search

The Lexicon is a **source of truth**. No other artifact may redefine a term.

---

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Primary goals

1. Provide a single place to define and lookup canonical terms.
2. Prevent drift by enforcing governance, versioning, and deprecation.
3. Embed the language into daily systems (CRM, templates, training, onboarding).
4. Enable fast retrieval: search, filtering, cross-links, synonyms, and tags.
5. Make changes safe: proposals, review, approval, publishing, and audit history.

### 2.2 Secondary goals

1. Provide a client-facing subset (optional) without exposing internal-only terms.
2. Enable AI assistance for drafting, mapping synonyms, and detecting collisions.
3. Measure adoption and areas of confusion via analytics.

### 2.3 Non-goals

1. Building a full knowledge base or SOP platform.
2. Replacing existing project management systems.
3. Creating a public glossary for marketing as the primary objective.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Katalyst is a multi-discipline organization combining strategy, design, manufacturing, and rollout execution. Overlapping language leads to:

* Misalignment on scope and “done” criteria
* Confusing handoffs and weak ownership
* Rework and project delays
* CRM inconsistency and reporting errors
* Training that does not scale

A controlled vocabulary with governance solves these problems by providing canonical meanings and enforcement mechanisms.

---

## 4. Users and Use Cases

### 4.1 Primary user groups

* Leadership: approves canonical terms, enforces language
* Client Services / PMs: daily planning, scope definition, handoffs
* Design: deliverable definitions and naming
* Production / Supply Chain: definitions for constraints, lead times, handoffs
* Finance: billing, revenue recognition, job costing terms
* Sales / Strategy: offer language, qualification, scope terms
* New hires: onboarding and vocabulary mastery

### 4.2 Core use cases

1. Look up a term quickly during a meeting.
2. Confirm which term is canonical vs deprecated.
3. Propose a new term or edit.
4. Review and approve proposed changes.
5. Link terms in templates and CRM fields.
6. Create a curated, client-safe subset.
7. Track confusion hotspots and adoption.

---

## 5. Information Architecture

### 5.1 Taxonomy (recommended)

Terms are organized by domain:

* Organizational and Structural
* Planning and Execution
* Commercial and Client
* Financial and Performance
* Cultural and Philosophical
* Design and Delivery Methodology
* System-Specific (Zoho, templates, etc.)

### 5.2 Term relationships

* **Synonym**: alternate wording mapping to canonical term
* **Related**: conceptually adjacent term
* **Parent/Child**: hierarchical (Program > Project > Phase > etc.)
* **Replaces / Replaced by**: for deprecated terms

### 5.3 Term entry template (canonical)

Each term must include:

* Term name (canonical)
* Category (domain)
* Definition (non-circular)
* Why it exists (problem solved)
* Used when (inclusion rules)
* Not used when (exclusion rules)
* Synonyms / legacy language (optional)
* Examples (good usage, bad usage)
* Status: Draft | Canonical | Deprecated
* Visibility: Internal | Client-safe | Public
* Owner (steward)
* Version + changelog

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Term management

* Create term (draft)
* Edit term (with versioning)
* Publish term (becomes canonical)
* Deprecate term (requires replacement guidance)
* Restore term version

### 6.2 Search and discovery

### 6.3 Browsing

* Category landing pages
* Hierarchy views (tree for structural terms)
* Relationship graph view (optional V2)

### 6.4 Governance workflow

Roles:

### 6.5 Audit and versioning

* Every change produces a new version
* Version diff view (field-by-field)

* Copy link / copy “short definition”
* Embed widget or snippet for internal tools (V2)

### 6.7 Client-safe subset

* Synonym searches resolve to canonical term

---

## 10. Adoption and Enforcement

### 10.1 Enforcement mechanisms

* CRM picklists and field names reference canonical terms
* Templates link to term pages
* Meeting norms: language correction is expected
* Leadership modeling

### 10.2 Rollout plan

* Phase 1: lock hierarchy terms (Program, Project, Phase, etc.)
* Phase 2: planning terms (conditions of satisfaction, constraints, owner)
* Phase 3: commercial offer language
* Phase 4: culture and methodology

---

## 11. AI Assistance (Optional)

### 11.1 Drafting support

* Suggest definitions from internal notes
* Suggest inclusion/exclusion criteria
* Generate examples and anti-examples

### 11.2 Collision detection

* Flag near-duplicate terms
* Detect circular definitions
* Detect inconsistent usage across templates and documents

### 11.3 Controlled usage

* AI cannot publish
* AI suggestions must be accepted by Editor/Approver

---

## 12. Technical Architecture

### 12.1 Recommended stack (pragmatic)

* Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind
* Backend: Node/Express or Next API routes
* Database: Postgres
* Search: Postgres full-text search initially; upgrade to Meilisearch/Elastic if needed
* Auth: Google Workspace SSO (OAuth) or Clerk
* Hosting: Vercel + managed Postgres (Neon/Supabase)

### 12.2 Alternatives

* Rapid V1 on Airtable/Notion with strict governance rules

  * Faster to ship, weaker enforcement
* Zoho Creator app

  * Native to Zoho ecosystem, may reduce integration effort

Recommendation: If Zoho is already the operational spine, strongly consider **Zoho Creator** for V1 and migrate later only if needed.

---

## 13. Integrations (V2)

* Zoho CRM: term references, field tooltips, data validation
* Google Drive: template annotations and term linking
* Slack: term lookup and “new term” notifications
* Internal GPT: canonical term retrieval as the first step in drafting

---

## 14. Metrics

### 14.1 Adoption

* Monthly active users
* Searches per user
* Top searched terms

### 14.2 Quality

* Number of deprecated terms
* Edit churn rate per term
* Time to approve proposals

### 14.3 Confusion

* Searches with no results
* Terms with highest proposal volume
* Most viewed deprecated terms

---

## 15. Risks and Mitigations

1. Becomes a dead document

   * Mitigation: governance + enforcement through systems

2. Over-engineering early

   * Mitigation: ship V1 with tight scope

3. Political conflict over language

   * Mitigation: approver role clarity and decision rights

4. Drift between internal and client-safe language

   * Mitigation: visibility flag discipline and separate views

---

## 16. MVP Scope (V1)

Must-have:

* Term CRUD with workflow
* Search and filters
* Canonical vs deprecated handling
* Versioning and audit log
* Roles: viewer, contributor, editor, approver, admin
* Client-safe visibility

Nice-to-have:

* Relationship graph
* Training quizzes
* Slack bot

---

## 17. Implementation Plan

### Sprint 0: Foundation

* Finalize taxonomy
* Define roles and governance
* Seed initial terms (hierarchy)

### Sprint 1: Core app

* Auth + RBAC
* Term model
* Term detail + browse

### Sprint 2: Workflow + versioning

* Proposals
* Review queue
* Diff + audit log

### Sprint 3: Visibility + client-safe view

* Visibility flags
* External subset view

### Sprint 4: Adoption tooling

* Weekly digest
* Analytics basics

---

## 18. Open Questions

1. Where should V1 live: Zoho Creator vs standalone web app?
2. Who are the Approvers: CEO only, or CEO + executive team?
3. What is the publication cadence: continuous or weekly batch?
4. Do we want a public-facing subset at all?

---

* Approver: decides canonical term and resolves collisions

### B. Term Definition Quality Checklist
