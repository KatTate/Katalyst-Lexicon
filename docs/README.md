## How To Use These Docs

These guides are designed to be:

1. **App-Agnostic**: Methods can be applied to any Replit project
2. **Walkthrough-Style**: Step-by-step processes you can follow
3. **Template-Driven**: Copy/paste templates to speed up your work

When starting a new feature or redesign, check this directory first to see if there's an applicable methodology.
