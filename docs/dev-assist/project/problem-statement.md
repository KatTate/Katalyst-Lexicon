# Problem Statement

*Source: Original design document + validation session 2026-01-10*

## Who Has This Problem?

**Primary Users:**
- Leadership: approves canonical terms, enforces language
- Client Services / PMs: daily planning, scope definition, handoffs
- Design: deliverable definitions and naming
- Production / Supply Chain: definitions for constraints, lead times, handoffs
- Finance: billing, revenue recognition, job costing terms
- Sales / Strategy: offer language, qualification, scope terms
- New hires: onboarding and vocabulary mastery

**Context:** Katalyst is a multi-discipline organization combining strategy, design, manufacturing, and rollout execution. Team members need to use consistent terminology across all these disciplines daily.

**Characteristics:** Mixed technical levels, work across multiple tools (CRM, templates, meetings), need quick access during live conversations.

## What Are They Trying To Do?

**Goal:** Use the correct, canonical language across all internal and client communications, grounded in shared principles and philosophies.

**Current Approach:** Ask colleagues, search old documents, guess, or use inconsistent terminology.

## The Problem

**Problem Statement:** Overlapping and inconsistent language across departments leads to misalignment, rework, and confusion. Additionally, the reasoning behind terminology choices and organizational philosophy is scattered or undocumented.

**Symptoms:**
- Misalignment on scope and "done" criteria
- Confusing handoffs and weak ownership
- Rework and project delays
- CRM inconsistency and reporting errors
- Training that does not scale
- Different departments using different terms for the same concept
- New employees don't understand the "why" behind organizational language
- Principles and philosophies exist in people's heads but aren't documented

**Impact:** Project delays, customer confusion, wasted time in meetings debating terminology, onboarding takes longer than necessary.

## Success Criteria

- Anyone can find the approved term in under 30 seconds
- New terms go through a governed approval process with full version history
- Deprecated terms are clearly marked with replacement guidance
- Terms are the single source of truth - no other artifact may redefine a term
- Client-safe subset available without exposing internal-only terms
- Principles and longer-form philosophies are documented and linked to related terms
- Full audit trail of all changes (who, what, when, why)

## Why This Matters

**Business Value:** 
- Reduced project delays from miscommunication
- Faster onboarding for new employees
- Consistent CRM data and reporting
- Professional, consistent client-facing language
- Institutional knowledge captured and preserved

**User Value:**
- Less guessing, more confidence
- Quick lookup during meetings
- Clear governance for language disputes
- Understanding the "why" behind terminology through linked principles

**Personal Motivation:** 
- Eliminate wasted time in meetings debating what words mean
- Create a scalable training system
- Preserve organizational philosophy as the company grows
